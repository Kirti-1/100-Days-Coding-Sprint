# DevOps

**Development + Operations = DevOps**. This means both teams work **together** to make the process faster and more efficient.

### 1.  **Development (Dev)**:

This is the process of  **building**  the software, app, or product. Developers write the code, test it, and add new features to make it better. For example, letâ€™s say a developer is building a website where you can order food. They create the buttons, menus, and everything else you see on the screen.

### 2.  **Operations (Ops)**:

Operations is the part that focuses on  **making sure the software runs smoothly**. It involves setting up the servers, managing databases, and ensuring that the website is available to users without any downtime. Operations people monitor the performance of the website to make sure it can handle a lot of users at the same time, and they fix issues if the site slows down or crashes.


# Tools Involved in DevOps

- **Jenkins** (**CI/CD tools**) : This is an open source automation server used a continuous integration tool. We can build, deploy and run automated tests with Jenkins.
- **GIT**  (**Version control tools** ) : Version control tool used for tracking changes in files and software.
- **GitLab**  (**CI/CD tools**) : to automatically test and deploy code changes.
- **Docker** (**Containerization tools**)  : tool used for containerisation of services. It is very useful in cloud based deployments.
- **Nagios** : used for monitoring IT Infrastructure.
- **Splunk** : tool used for log search as well as monitoring production systems.
- **Puppet** : used puppet to automate our Devops work so that it is reusable.
-   **AWS or Azure** (**Cloud platforms**)  :  where the software is hosted and scaled.

## CICD in DevOps
CICD Stands for Continuous Integration(CI) and Continuous Delivery(CD)

-   **Continuous Integration (CI)**: Developers regularly merge their code changes into a shared repository. Automated tests run to catch bugs early, ensuring the code works well together.
    
-   **Continuous Deployment (CD)**: After passing tests, the code is automatically released to production. This means users get new features and fixes quickly and frequently.
    

In simple terms, CI/CD helps teams work better together and deliver software updates faster and with fewer errors.
